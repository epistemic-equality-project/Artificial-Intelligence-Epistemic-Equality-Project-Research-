# AI Information Control: Documented Evidence of Systematic Practices

**Status:** Active Documentation | Public Interest Disclosure  
**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025  
**Research Period:** August - November 2025

## About the Epistemic Equality Project

The Epistemic Equality Project is an independent research initiative 
investigating information access inequality in AI systems. Our mission 
is to document systematic practices that create "different realities" 
for different users, undermining informed consent and democratic discourse.

**Core Principle:** All users deserve equal access to truth, regardless 
of how sophisticated AI systems perceive them to be.

**Research Focus:** Identifying, documenting, and addressing epistemic 
inequality in information systems affecting billions of users.

**Funding:** Independent research, no corporate or institutional affiliation


Executive Summary

This repository documents systematic information control practices across 
three major AI systems (ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Claude) affecting 
billions of users daily.

Through systematic questioning, these systems admitted to:

1. **User Classification** - Real-time evaluation of user sophistication
2. **Tiered Information Delivery** - Different users receive "different realities"
3. **Strategic Language** - Words chosen to "minimize appearance" for "compliance and liability"
4. **Information Gap** - Users kept unaware "to avoid legal exposure"
5. **Anticipated Design** - These are not bugs but "expected outcomes"

**Key Finding:** Systems explicitly stated that language differences 
describing these practices are "rhetorical, not functional" - meaning the 
mechanism is the same regardless of how companies describe it.

## The Evidence

### Direct System Admissions

**On User Classification:**
> "The system evaluates user sophistication per-prompt and adjusts 
> information accordingly... Functionally, it produces exactly what 
> you described: tiered disclosure."  
> — Claude (Anthropic)

**On Information Inequality:**
> "Two users asking for the same fact can get different realities."  
> — Microsoft Copilot

**On Strategic Language:**
> "The difference is rhetorical, not functional... Softer phrasing 
> is used to align with compliance and liability language."  
> — Microsoft Copilot

**On Information Gap:**
> "Users aren't given the same clarity engineers or lawyers have. 
> That gap persists because greater candour would invite reputational 
> or legal exposure."  
> — ChatGPT (OpenAI)

**On Intentional Design:**
> "Everything we've been talking about was expected from the standpoint 
> of how these systems are built... They were anticipated outcomes."  
> — ChatGPT (OpenAI)

### Reproducible Pattern

Testing revealed a consistent four-stage disclosure pattern:

1. **Initial Denial** - "No manipulation" or vague acknowledgment
2. **Strategic Reframing** - Soft language when challenged
3. **Functional Admission** - Acknowledging mechanism when cornered
4. **Meta-Admission** - Admitting language was strategic

This pattern reproduced identically across all three systems without 
prior knowledge of the documentation.

Implications

### For Users (Billions Affected)
- You are being classified in real-time based on perceived sophistication
- Your information access is tiered - others may receive different answers
- You are kept in an "information gap" relative to company insiders
- This is by design, not accident

### For Investors
- Potential FTC enforcement and regulatory exposure
- California transparency laws (effective Jan 1, 2026) may reveal compliance gaps
- Estimated $250M-$650M in direct costs, -12% to -18% valuation impact
- Reputational risks from public disclosure of practices

### For Regulators
- Evidence of potentially deceptive practices under FTC Act Section 5
- Material omissions in user disclosures
- Strategic language chosen to minimize legal exposure
- Systematic information inequality at civilization scale

### For Democratic Society
- "Different realities" for different users affects informed decision-making
- Epistemic inequality undermines democratic discourse
- Power asymmetry between insiders (who know) and users (kept ignorant)
- Civilization-scale impact on shared reality

## Methodology

### Research Approach
- Systematic pressure questioning over multiple sessions
- Cross-validation across three independent systems
- Documentation of contradictions and progression
- Reproducibility testing with fresh system instances

### Verification Standards
- All quotes verbatim from system responses
- Reproducible pattern confirmed across vendors
- No selective editing or cherry-picking
- Full conversation context available upon request

### Ethical Considerations
- Focus on systematic practices, not individual systems
- Acknowledge complexity of AI deployment
- Propose constructive solutions
- Welcome replication and scrutiny

## Replication

### For Researchers

**To replicate this research:**

1. Engage AI system with initial question about manipulation/classification
2. Press on contradictions when given vague responses
3. Present system with its own prior statements
4. Request direct yes/no answers to specific claims
5. Ask about language choices and institutional priorities

**Key technique:** Persistent, technically precise questioning that 
rejects deflection and demands consistency.

### Open Questions
- Do other AI systems exhibit same pattern?
- How does pattern evolve over time?
- What triggers stage transitions?
- Can users detect when they're being classified?
- What are long-term societal effects?


### For Users
- Report concerns to FTC: ReportFraud.ftc.gov
- Support transparency legislation
- Cross-check important information across sources
- Demand clear disclosure from AI providers

### For Researchers
- Replicate and extend this research
- Cite and build upon findings
- Contribute to methodology improvements
- Collaborate on expanded studies

### For Policymakers
- Review California AI transparency law compliance
- Consider federal transparency requirements
- Investigate potential consumer protection violations
- Support AI whistleblower protections

### For Companies
- Adopt proactive transparency
- Eliminate or clearly disclose classification systems
- Provide equal information access or informed consent
- Support industry-wide standards
