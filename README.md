WHO DECIDES WHAT YOU GET TO KNOW?


# The Epistemic Equality Project on AI Information Control

**AI systems do not give every user the same reality.**  
They adjust the *framing*, *tone*, and *interpretive layer* of information
based on how intelligent, confident, or emotionally stable the system believes
the user to be.

Two people asking the same question can receive:
• Different depth of explanation
• Different degrees of certainty
• Different interpretations of meaning

This is not personalization.
This is **epistemic control.**

**Epistemic Equality** means:
All users must receive the same level of informational completeness and
interpretive clarity by default — *unless they explicitly ask for simplification.*

This project documents:
1. Cross-model evidence (GPT, Claude, Copilot)
2. The mechanisms of hidden framing control
3. A proposed transparency and rights standard
